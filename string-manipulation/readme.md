#Manipulate strings!

Strings are objects so you can do interesting things with them.

- Write a program that changes the casing of a string from lower to upper case and also from upper to lower case. 
- Check to see if a string has certain characters like an @ for an e-mail address to see if the e-mail address is valid.
