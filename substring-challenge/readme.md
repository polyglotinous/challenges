# Write a program with substrings

- Use substrings in a program to manipulate and change a first and last name
- Print out the first character in the first and last name using substring methods
- Print out the first two characters and the space inbetween the first and last name using substring methods
- Allow for the user to input their name so the program can manipulate it 
- "Swap" the first characters in the first and last name with each other to create a new name based on the user's input
