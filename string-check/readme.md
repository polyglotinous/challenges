#A program that checks strings exactly

- Create a program that creates a GUI box which asks for the user to input a color or item and lists out which items to select from.
- When the user types an exact string in the box, the program responds with some text based off their input

Example:

- program: "Pick a color, either red, blue, or white"
    - User types color red in all lower case
- program: "You're a commie aren't you!"
