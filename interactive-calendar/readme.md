<b><h1>Interactive Calendar</h1></b>


Create a program which asks the user for today's date in this format: 8/6/2015 (month/day/year) so that when the user does this and hits enter, the program will respond by printing out the current day of that date (a Monday, Tuesday, etc.) To let the user know what day of the week that date is.
