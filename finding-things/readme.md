# Find things in an array

Write a program that includes an array of at least six numbers which finds and prints: 
- The numbers in the array
- The average of the numbers in the array
- The largest number in the array
- Only the odd numbers in the array

In addition, the numbers in the array should initially NOT be in order from largest to smallest or smallest to largest.
