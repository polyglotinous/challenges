# Find the area of a rectangle

- Ask for user input to find the area of a rectangle based on the strings they enter. 
- Convert the strings to integers.
- Have boxes ask the user for input and have a box print out the area of the rectangle based on their inputs. 

Bonus: Is there a way to accomodate integers AND floating points and still using the .parse method?
