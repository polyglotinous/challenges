<b><h1> BMI Calculator </h1></b>

Create a program that asks for the user's height in inches and weight in pounds, and based off the user's input, states the user's correct BMI. 

<b> Bonus exercises: </b>

<ul>

  <li> See if you can ask the user for feet and then inches separately, then their weight in pounds, and then finally have the program calculate and print the user's BMI based off of their input. </li>

  <li> After this, see if you can round the BMI to the closest two decimal places. </li>

</ul>
